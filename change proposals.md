1. 'IT support for people who don't speak tech' and 'tech support made simple' clash, both say the same thing and doesn't need to be listed twice. tech support made simple can be removed and can only show stats/numbers (years in buisness etc)
2. why people choose us also says the same thing as the first line, its just repeating ourselves
3. services needs to be revised, I'm not sure if we offer tech education in the sense of tech courses or something the like.
