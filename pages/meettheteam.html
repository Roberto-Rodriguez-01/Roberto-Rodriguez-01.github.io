    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
      North Byte IT started with a simple goal:
      make high-quality tech support accessible to everyone 
      ‚Äî not just large companies. After working in enterprise environments for years, 
      we saw how often individuals and small businesses were left behind. 
      So we set out to change that.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
      Our mission is built on listening first and solving second. 
      We believe in treating every project with real attention, 
      whether it's launching a new business, building a custom PC, 
      or getting your Wi-Fi to finally behave. If it matters to you, it matters to us.
